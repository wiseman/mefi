    "plaintext": "Weather proof a window after A/C Window Installation?\n\nThe house I live in has windows that can be 'removed', I don't know what these windows are called, basically it looks like a normal window but the half that you move up and down has 'tabs' that you can slide out and remove the whole section of the window.\n\nNot really a problem unless you are not careful opening and closing a window there is a gap between upper window and bottom window.\n\nThat is the issue I'm having. When I install the A/C window unit I of course have to raise the lower part up and put the window unit in. There is a remarkable gap between where the window is raise and the upper window as not 'flush against' the upper window when raised.\n\nWhat can I do to close that gap off, its about an inch, inch and a half. I have tried weatherization products like 'vinyl seals' but they wear off after awhile and also a piece of 'foam' that Duck Brand sells to put in the gap but that doesn't stay/fill the gaps, a simple lighter to the window flickers wildly still.\n\nAny thoughts or tips would be appreciated.",

It's about two inches wide, super sticky and made to seal that plastic wrap they put around houses to seal them off from drafts, etc. It's pretty aggressive, so be careful how you hold it to apply it, but it will stick to glass, metal, wood, whatever. You can mold it into the corners where the glass meets the frame. Find it at any good hardware store, even Lowes or Home Depot.",

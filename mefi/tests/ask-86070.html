<div class="copy">Working in an office is destroying me! What kind of work can I do that will keep me out of one? <br>

<div style="border-top:1px dotted #777;margin-top:6px;padding-right:20px;">

<br> I am working my first office job after graduating from college last spring. I’ve been there about six months now and apparently working in an office is totally soul-crushing for me. I can just not handle sitting at a desk staring at a computer for eight hours at a time. About ten minutes after I arrive, I am already antsy to leave and by the afternoon I am often nearly in tears because I hate sitting there so much. The office itself isn’t even one of those gray, cubicle-like offices I’ve heard of, but a bright office in a cool old building with an open floor plan. But it’s the sitting in one place staring at a screen all day that really destroys me.<br>
Of course it doesn’t help that my work is totally boring and pointless. It’s a small company and when I started I was really excited about having my first ‘real job’ and was super friendly to all my co-workers, but since then they have demonstrated a total disinterest in having anything to do with me. I do not exchange a single word with anyone all day. I really like to interact with people, and this part might be as equally devastating to me as the sitting at the desk part.<br>
I know very well that life is too short for me to be putting up with this. Every evening I live in dread of returning to work the following morning. At this point, I am really having trouble figuring out what sort of work won’t make me feel like this. I graduated with a major in anthropology and a minor in Russian. I love books, languages, being outside, yoga, traveling and being with people. I am super active person and have sort of short attention span, so I tend to jump from one thing to another really quickly. I have a lot of difficulty even sitting through a whole movie. I know that most people don’t have a job doing what they love, but I think I should at least be able to find something that I don’t hate. <br>
What kind of work can I do that doesn’t involve being in the office situation? If I can get something that involves using my degree that would be great, but I am certainly willing to do something that doesn’t require it. While I was in school I worked as a waitress for a year and I didn’t really care for that. I also spent some time working as a delivery driver, which I liked quite a bit, but made me feel guilty about driving all day. I live in Minneapolis and am married. My husband has a job that he likes, so I’d prefer to be able to find something that we wouldn’t have to move for. <br>
Thanks in advance for your help. Throw-away e-mail: officeescape@gmail.com</div>

<a name="1272248"></a><div class="comments" id="c1272248">This is random and out-there, but my brother-in-law has worked at Lenscrafters for years and loves it. He does mostly lab work -- making lenses in the back -- but he also does a little bit of retail stuff, showing people around and helping them pick out glasses, and then fitting the new glasses to make sure the frame is adjusted properly, etc. <br>
<br>
He's tried cubicle jobs before, but like you he's too restless to sit at a computer all day. His job at Lenscrafters lets him move around and gives him a variety of work, some of which involves people and some of which is technical, detailed work. He's an introvert, and definitely not someone who'd ever work in &quot;Sales,&quot; but he really loves glasses and enjoys working the retail side as much as the lab work. <br>
<br>
Anything in retail/sales will give you a chance to interact with people more, but the quality of retail jobs varies wildly. Working in a small specialty boutique (comic books, yarn, shoes -- anything you have a passion for) won't pay much, but it can be fun if you work for/with good people. And maybe check out Lenscrafters; they're in just about every mall anywhere.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/user/13894" target="_self">junkbox</a> at <a href="/86070/OMG-I-need-to-get-away-from-this-damn-desk#1272248" target="_self">8:48 AM</a>  on March 14, 2008 </span></div><br><br>

<a name="1272251"></a><div class="comments" id="c1272251">If you love Yoga, and you love people, why not become a certified yoga instructor? You'll likely work for several different studios, and thus will have a variety of environments and students to interact with daily. You'll stay active yourself, and may even find your restlessness and short attention span calming a bit. <br>
<br>
Yoga teacher training is offered many places, but be sure to get references and recommendations, as there have been some shady fly-by-night training programs/scams int he last few years (in my area, anyway).<br>
<br>
Good luck to you, whatever you end up doing!<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/user/52744" target="_self">minervous</a> at <a href="/86070/OMG-I-need-to-get-away-from-this-damn-desk#1272251" target="_self">8:49 AM</a>  on March 14, 2008 </span></div><br><br>

It isn't office work that's getting to you.  It is the monotony of life at work.

<a name="1272278"></a><div class="comments" id="c1272278">Damn Dirty Ape, (the second half of) your answer is not helpful. We <em>don't</em> live in pre-modern society. We (meaning most of those who visit metafilter, probably including the poster) <em>don't</em> live in a third world country. I don't think he sounds whiny. It's fine that you do, and offering some perspective can be helpful. Insulting the poster is not.<br>
<br>
Anyhow, anon, have you thought about grad school? While you're in school, I would think (though I don't know that much about anthro) that you could find an enjoyable research assistant position that involves plenty of field work. Interviewing and the like. Afterwards, if you pursue a career in academia, you could try to put yourself out in the field plenty as well.<br>
<br>
Also, I agree that part of the problem seems to be specifically your job. Try finding a job somewhere where the people are friendlier (which may be highly related to the non-crapiness of the job or company). I also think it's probably worth at least making an appointment to get screened for ADD.<br>
<br>
One last thought. I mentioned that offering perspective can be helpful. Well, it's true that plenty of people are worse off than you. That doesn't make you whiny or a bad person for disliking your job. But one thing you could try is finding a wage job and doing that for a while. That could help you find perspective on your own. It could give you time to think about what you really want. There are plenty of places to work where the jobs are somewhat crappy, but the people are nice. You could do that for a while, until you feel ready to move on to another &quot;real job&quot;. It could help you decide if you can stand an office only job, or if you need something where you get up and about at least sometimes.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/user/25755" target="_self">gauchodaspampas</a> at <a href="/86070/OMG-I-need-to-get-away-from-this-damn-desk#1272278" target="_self">9:14 AM</a>  on March 14, 2008 </span></div><br><br>

<a name="1272282"></a><div class="comments" id="c1272282">I also hate cubicle life, so I understand where you are coming from. A couple of years ago I decided to put my graphic design experience to work again, and got a job at a newspaper in a nice building with great people and interesting projects, but still quit after a year because of the sitting in one place thing. If you are able to find a job where you work from home, it might not be so bad since you'd have more control over your workspace, stretching breaks, etc.<br>
<br>
My previous gig was sourcing and building theatrical props, which I have since returned to. Because I work for a relatively small theater, I am also responsible for shopping for furniture, props, and set dressing. Larger theaters often employ a dedicated shopper, however. With a background in anthropology and in interest in literature, a job as a dedicated prop shopper rather than prop designer might be right up your ally. The pay is not great, but the work is often interesting and you'll be on your feet, wandering around and exploring new places every day, especially if you are based out of an urban theater. You'll get to interact with all sorts of specialty vendors and artisans. <br>
<br>
One caveat, however. I don't enjoy shopping as entertainment, and successful prop shoppers generally don't, since speed and efficiency are important. Every day is like playing a game of high pressure &quot;scavenger hunt&quot;. If you have an eye for good design and a short attention span, I bet you'd enjoy the work. Since you don't have an interior design, theater, or art degree, finding a theater that offers a props internship would be your foot in the door.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/user/30351" target="_self">stagewhisper</a> at <a href="/86070/OMG-I-need-to-get-away-from-this-damn-desk#1272282" target="_self">9:18 AM</a>  on March 14, 2008 </span></div><br><br>

It's challenging but almost never boring (though I'll admit that there are some things I have to research that always my cup of tea, mezzanine financing I'm lookin' at you).

Also, archaeology is about 3:1 office time to fieldwork so I'm afraid if you ever want to move beyond being an intinerant field grunt, some time in front of the computer is necessary.  But being a field grunt is hecka fun and can pay pretty decent too, depending on where you work (Western states pay more).  I know at least one company (a former employer) in your area that does this (I can give you some info if you rsvp via my profile email) but a simple Google search for &quot;CRM&quot; or &quot;Environmental Consulting&quot; will give you a bunch more options.

<a name="1272391"></a><div class="comments" id="c1272391">I don't have any suggestions about non-office jobs, but one thing you wrote really jumped out at me--you're just hitting the six-month mark of your first office job out of school?<br>
<br>
At the beginning of March, so we're just starting to come out of the darkest, coldest, least-sunlight part of the year?<br>
<br>
Yeah, I'm not at all surprised that you feel like working in an office is totally soul-crushing. I <a href="http://ask.metafilter.com/77736/Stuck-in-a-bog-of-Graduate-Decisions#1155734">answered</a> a question a while back from someone who was in a similar situation to you and considering going back to grad school, and I think parts of it may be helpful here as a different perspective. From that link:<br>
<br>
<em>I should just point out that I, along with nearly every single one of my friends, had a really hard adjustment to office life in the first year out of undergrad. For me, the absolute *worst* of it was about 6 months in. (I think this is similar for a lot of people, because for your whole academic life until now, you've only ever had to tough it out for a semester of boring work, at which point you could generally switch or drop classes. Realizing you can't--that there's no break coming after 6 months--is profoundly depressing at first.) My unhappiness in my job was completely unexpected, because no one had ever mentioned how difficult the transition between college and a 9-5 office job would be, even if you are totally suited for your job...  College, particularly if you went to a good college, doesn't really prepare you for the fact that everyone starts at the bottom, and the fact that most people have to do work well below their skill level for a year or two before proving themselves and getting better stuff.</em><br>
<br>
The six-month mark for the first office job hit me, all of my friends in this city, and almost every new grad who gets hired at my company, like a bag of bricks. You don't talk much about what career field your current job is in, so I'm not sure how applicable this is, but if it's in something that you really thought you would love, it might be a good idea to stick it out at least until June or July. For the vast majority of my friends (although not all of them), it really really got better by about a year in. It'd be a shame to chuck it out the window if it's something you could ultimately be happy at, because the initial adjustment is so hard.<br>
<br>
(By about January/February of my first year on the job, I was having vivid, vivid fantasies about quitting my job and going back to school to be a masseuse--it literally seemed like the best job I'd ever heard of. I wouldn't be working in an office! I'd set my own hours! I craved sunlight and fresh air like an underfed anemic craves a steak. I am *oh so glad* that I wasn't able to put my scheme into action, because I'm pretty happy at my job now. It was just hell to get over the initial hump. I can almost guarantee April will be better, if for no other reason than the sunlight. Sweet, sweet sunlight.)<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/user/50819" target="_self">iminurmefi</a> at <a href="/86070/OMG-I-need-to-get-away-from-this-damn-desk#1272391" target="_self">10:48 AM</a>  on March 14, 2008 [<a href="/favorited/4/1272391" style="font-weight:normal;" title="4 users marked this as favorite">4 favorites</a>] </span></div><br><br>

<a name="1272439"></a><div class="comments" id="c1272439">This is an issue which plagues me as well, though my situation is a little different.  I have a good paying job with a friendly laid back work environment, yet I still have a hard time dragging myself out of bed in the morning and dread the thought of going in to the office.  Every day my resolve grows in the belief that it is against the nature of man to spend eight hours a day sitting behind a desk.<br>
<br>
I was ranting about this to a friend of mine when he was in town on break from school and he told me how he raised some money to pay off some of his debt.  He has a skill for glasswork--stained glass and the like--and he came up with an idea.  He spent a day making two-hundred small glass pieces (the description of which eludes me) and the next day he went on the New York trains and started selling them.  He sold all of them for $20 apiece.  You can do the math, but I could personally get by for more than two months on that.<br>
<br>
My friend recommended the book &quot;The 4-Hour Work Week&quot; to me.  It's a good book about finding ways to streamline your work life in such a way that you don't have to spend so much time in the office, as well as building alternate and (hopefully) automated sources of income.  My personal path for alternate income is going to take a while, but it is something I enjoy doing immensely: learning about computers and hopefully eventually creating some much needed software.<br>
<br>
In the meantime, I have developed the &quot;F#@k it!&quot; approach at work.  This sounds counterproductive, but for me at least, throwing out any concern for keeping my job or maintaining the approval of my peers has actually improved the quality of my work and the speed with which I get it done, as well as to make my relationships with my coworkers more easy going.  I don't stress out about deadlines and I take the scenic route to achieving tasks, which actually does a better job of keeping me on task.  I can't say that it will work for everyone (in fact it probably won't) but maybe you should try not caring!<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/user/65087" target="_self">mockdeep</a> at <a href="/86070/OMG-I-need-to-get-away-from-this-damn-desk#1272439" target="_self">11:33 AM</a>  on March 14, 2008 [<a href="/favorited/4/1272439" style="font-weight:normal;" title="2 users marked this as favorite">2 favorites</a>] </span></div><br><br>

<br>
In my case though, I'm convinced it's this particular office since the position I'm in since I was warned by a staffing agent that it is a revolving door for all of the unfortunate staffing agencies charged with filling this position.  Eight months in and I'm starting to see why.<br>
<br>
Try another office job.  Work absolutely sucks when you aren't getting any respect from your co-workers and you start feeling like Milton from Office Space (you're relegated to a crappy desk, have few--if any--meaningful responsibilities, get shafted out of events everybody else gets to partake in and are generally ignored).<br>
<br>
<i>I should just point out that I, along with nearly every single one of my friends, had a really hard adjustment to office life in the first year out of undergrad. For me, the absolute *worst* of it was about 6 months in. (I think this is similar for a lot of people, because for your whole academic life until now, you've only ever had to tough it out for a semester of boring work, at which point you could generally switch or drop classes. Realizing you can't--that there's no break coming after 6 months--is profoundly depressing at first.)</i> - iminurmefi<br>
<br>
Personally, I don't think it's about the semester-long work--the hardest adjustment for me was just being forced to get up at the same time every day and doing the exact same thing every single day.  College does not prepare you at all for this either-- usually your classes have wacky hours and you typically don't have the same classes every day.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/user/24841" target="_self">Ziggy Zaga</a> at <a href="/86070/OMG-I-need-to-get-away-from-this-damn-desk#1273103" target="_self">6:31 AM</a>  on March 15, 2008 </span></div><br><br>

<br>
As you get more efficient you should be able to get more done faster and find a way to spend some time thinking of your other interests at work. For instance, if the job involves a lot of waiting around for printouts and faxes, bring a clipboard with a few magazine articles from home on it so you can read. In fact, cutting and pasting and printing a few articles everyday before work is a good way to get mini breaks. <br>
<br>
If the job involved working on graphic design, I'd do what the client wants, then make my own version of the work for my portfolio.<br>

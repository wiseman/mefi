    "plaintext": "Working in an office is destroying me! What kind of work can I do that will keep me out of one?\n\nI am working my first office job after graduating from college last spring. I\u2019ve been there about six months now and apparently working in an office is totally soul-crushing for me. I can just not handle sitting at a desk staring at a computer for eight hours at a time. About ten minutes after I arrive, I am already antsy to leave and by the afternoon I am often nearly in tears because I hate sitting there so much. The office itself isn\u2019t even one of those gray, cubicle-like offices I\u2019ve heard of, but a bright office in a cool old building with an open floor plan. But it\u2019s the sitting in one place staring at a screen all day that really destroys me.\nOf course it doesn\u2019t help that my work is totally boring and pointless. It\u2019s a small company and when I started I was really excited about having my first \u2018real job\u2019 and was super friendly to all my co-workers, but since then they have demonstrated a total disinterest in having anything to do with me. I do not exchange a single word with anyone all day. I really like to interact with people, and this part might be as equally devastating to me as the sitting at the desk part.\nI know very well that life is too short for me to be putting up with this. Every evening I live in dread of returning to work the following morning. At this point, I am really having trouble figuring out what sort of work won\u2019t make me feel like this. I graduated with a major in anthropology and a minor in Russian. I love books, languages, being outside, yoga, traveling and being with people. I am super active person and have sort of short attention span, so I tend to jump from one thing to another really quickly. I have a lot of difficulty even sitting through a whole movie. I know that most people don\u2019t have a job doing what they love, but I think I should at least be able to find something that I don\u2019t hate.\nWhat kind of work can I do that doesn\u2019t involve being in the office situation? If I can get something that involves using my degree that would be great, but I am certainly willing to do something that doesn\u2019t require it. While I was in school I worked as a waitress for a year and I didn\u2019t really care for that. I also spent some time working as a delivery driver, which I liked quite a bit, but made me feel guilty about driving all day. I live in Minneapolis and am married. My husband has a job that he likes, so I\u2019d prefer to be able to find something that we wouldn\u2019t have to move for.\nThanks in advance for your help.

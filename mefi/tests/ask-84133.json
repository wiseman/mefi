It's like asking how can you have the same dream. My understanding of dreams is that they are random bits of imagery generated or at least influenced by the firing of neurons during sleep. The emotional response we have to the images is what is revealing, not the actual content of the vision. So what you can get more of is making space for a personal response to randomly generated imagery, but it's quite likely that you'll never get the exact same feelings triggered again. Since you are seeking out the makyo, don't practice meditation. I think that meditation is good for most people but it's not really congruent with your goal. Look into some of the other suggestions, active imagination, self-hypnosis, progressive relaxation, and lucid dreaming. Lucid dreaming will give you the most active control over the imagery.\n\nThe hypnotherapist probably mentioned this, but you do know that your attitude about hypnosis has an effect on the session? There's a lot of misconceptions about what it can do. If you expect it to come in and do the work you'll be disappointed. It can manifest as remembering your goals right before you eat.
